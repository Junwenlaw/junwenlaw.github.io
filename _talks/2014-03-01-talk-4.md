excerpt: Using a multi-sector capacity expansion model for the contiguous U.S., we show that hydrogen deployment is shaped largely by infrastructure availability, with green hydrogen favored when storage and pipelines are available, while limited infrastructure shifts supply toward blue hydrogen. We also find that grid-connected systems enable greater electrolytic hydrogen production, underscoring important synergies between electricity and hydrogen supply chains in net-zero energy systems.
