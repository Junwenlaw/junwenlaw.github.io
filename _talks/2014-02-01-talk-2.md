title: "<u>Systematic assessment of liquid fuel production pathways in cost-optimized, net-zero energy systems</u>"

excerpt: This study presents a multi-sector capacity expansion model for the contiguous U.S., showing that biofuels supply a substantial share of liquid demand while fossil liquids persist when emissions can be offset. The balance between fossil, synthetic, and biofuels is shaped primarily by biomass and CO2 storage availability, and to a lesser extent by fuel demand distributions and supply flexibility.
