Hello! I am a final year Ph.D. candidate at MIT advised by [Prof. Robert Armstrong](https://energy.mit.edu/profile/robert-armstrong/) and [Prof. Dharik Mallapragada](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/dharik-mallapragada), and affliated with the [MIT Energy Initiative](https://energy.mit.edu). I build energy system optimization models to evaluate viable energy transition strategies. I am on the job market for roles starting in September 2026.

My research develops **multi-sector energy system models** to study how **renewable electricity, hydrogen, sustainable fuels, and carbon-management strategies** interact with infrastructure and policy design to shape long-term decarbonization pathways. I’m also developing methodological advances that improve the scalability and realism of energy system modeling. 

My broader interests include economy-wide decarbonization, climate and energy policy, urban and industrial energy systems, and techno-economic and life cycle assessment. Feel free to reach out via email if you’d like to chat about research or collaboration!

Prior to MIT, I received my undergradaute degree in Chemical Engineering at [NUS](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/chbe/), and spent a semester as a visiting student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). My industry experience include internships at [Woodside Energy](https://www.woodside.com) and [AspenTech](https://www.aspentech.com/en).

Outside of research, I enjoy traveling, photography, and playing music. These interests give me space to explore creativity and stay grounded, playing a complementary role to the analytical nature of my academic work.
