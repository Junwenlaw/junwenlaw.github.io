Hello! I am a final year Ph.D. candidate at MIT advised by [Prof. Robert Armstrong](https://energy.mit.edu/profile/robert-armstrong/) and [Prof. Dharik Mallapragada](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/dharik-mallapragada), and affliated with the [MIT Energy Initiative](https://energy.mit.edu). I build energy system optimization models to evaluate decarbonization pathways and feasible energy transition strategies. I am on the job market for roles starting in September 2026, with a preference for opportunities in Europe.

My research develops **multi-sector energy system models** to study how **renewable electricity, hydrogen, sustainable fuels, and carbon-management strategies** interact with infrastructure and policy design to shape long-term decarbonization pathways. I’m also interested in methodological advances that improve the scalability and realism of energy system modeling. Feel free to reach out via email if you’d like to chat about research or collaboration!

Prior to MIT, I received my undergradaute degree in Chemical Engineering at [NUS](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/chbe/), and spent a semester as a visiting student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). My industry experience include internships at [Woodside Energy](https://www.woodside.com) and [AspenTech](https://www.aspentech.com/en).

Outside of research, I enjoy traveling, photography, and playing music. These interests give me space to explore creativity and stay grounded, playing a complementary role to the analytical nature of my academic work.
