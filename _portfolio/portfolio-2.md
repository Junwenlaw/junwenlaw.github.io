title: "DOLPHYN (Decision Optimization for Low Carbon Power and Hydrogen Nexus)"
paperurl: "https://github.com/macroenergy/Dolphyn.jl"
excerpt: "I contribute to the development of <b>DOLPHYN</b>, an open-source optimization model that integrates electricity and hydrogen supply chains within a unified framework. It represents production, storage, transmission, and end-use across multiple vectors, capturing key interactions such as hydrogen-power coupling. My work focuses on extending the model’s carbon management and biofuel representation, enabling broader analysis of cross-sector decarbonization pathways.<br/><img src='/images/Dolphyn3.png'>"
