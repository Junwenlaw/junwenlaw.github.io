excerpt: "I am part of the core development team for <i>MACRO</i>, an open-source, energy system optimization model that flexibly represent electricity, fuels, hydrogen, CO2, and industrial systems within a unified graph-based architecture. The model supports technologically rich, high–resolution analysis through a modular “plug-and-play” architecture, enabled by advances in clustering methods, decomposition algorithms, and compact technology representations.<br/><img src='/images/Macro3.png'>"
