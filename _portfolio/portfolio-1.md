excerpt: "I am part of the core development team for <b><i>MACRO</i></b>, an open-source energy system optimization framework that co-optimizes the design and operation of multi-sector systems. It uses a unified graph-based architecture that flexibly represents electricity, fuels, hydrogen, CO2, industrial processes, and other sectors, enabling technologically rich, high-resolution analysis through a modular “plug-and-play” structure. The framework is built for large-scale applications, supported by advances in clustering methods, decomposition algorithms, and compact technology representations.<br/><img src='/images/Macro3.png'>"
