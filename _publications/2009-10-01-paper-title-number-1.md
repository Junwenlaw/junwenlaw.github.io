title: "Role of technology flexibility and grid coupling on hydrogen deployment in net-zero energy systems"
collection: publications
excerpt: "We use a multi-sector energy system model to examine how grid connectivity, hydrogen storage, and technology choices shape competition among low-carbon hydrogen pathways. The results inform policy decisions on infrastructure planning and system operations for hydrogen production in net-zero energy systems."
