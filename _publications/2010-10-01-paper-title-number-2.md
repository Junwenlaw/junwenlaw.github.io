title: "Decarbonization pathways for liquid fuels: A multi-sector energy
system perspective"
collection: publications
excerpt: "Using a multi-sector capacity expansion model, we assess how biomass and carbon sequestration availability, fuel demand distribution, and supply flexibility drive competition among biofuels, synthetic fuels, and fossil liquids pathways. The findings clarify how resource constraints govern feasible fuel mixes, providing guidance for policy on biomass allocation and carbon management."
