title: "Multi-sectoral impacts of H2 and synthetic fuels adoption for
heavy-duty transportation decarbonization"
collection: publications
excerpt: "We link a transport demand model with a multi-sector energy system model to compare hydrogen and synthetic liquid fuels for decarbonizing heavy-duty vehicles in Western Europe. The analysis quantifies system-wide trade-offs in costs, fuel switching, and carbon management strategies, offering insights for transport and energy policy."
